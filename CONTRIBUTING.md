# Contributing to SkillMatch.AI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to SkillMatch.AI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/rubyferdianto/SkillMatch.AI/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rubyferdianto/SkillMatch.AI/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a conda environment: `conda create -n smai python=3.11`
3. Activate the environment: `conda activate smai`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run tests: `python tests/test_basic.py`

## Code Style

* We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for Python code formatting
* We use [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting
* Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
* Use type hints where possible

## Testing

* Add tests for any new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Test both happy path and edge cases
